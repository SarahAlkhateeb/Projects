## Masters Projects
### Some of my masters degree projects (MSc Applied Data Science)*


**Deep Machine learning project:**

We applied the You Only Look Once (YOLOv4) algorithm to weapons detection because YOLO approved to be the fastest so far and can be implemented in real-time detection. Automating weapons detection could be beneficial, especially if it were fast enough to send an alert in real-time. We focused on two categories of weapons: guns and knives. There are lots of images of guns and knives available online, and they are probably the most commonly used weapons, so they will be the most useful to detect.

## Data Analysis Projects
#### Some of the above projects are parts of my Data Analyst Nanodegree (Bertelsmann Udacity Data Science Scholarship Program), and here is a short description of each one:

* **Explore Weather Trends:**
  - In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends of a city to overall global             temperature trends. I used SQL to extract data from the temperatures database, created visualizations (using Excel) and prepared a         write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city     to where I live.
 
  
* **Bike Share Analysis:** 
  - In this project, I explored data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States: New York City,       Chicago, and Washington, DC, performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems, wrote code to compute           descriptive statistics and used visualization as part of the exploration. In this analysis, we answered several questions such as:         Which city has the highest number of trips? Which city has the highest proportion of trips made by subscribers? Which city has the         highest proportion of trips made by short-term customers? What is the average trip length for each city? What proportion of rides made     in each city are longer than 30 minutes?...
 

* **Investigate a Dataset:**
  - In this project, I conducted my own data analysis using a random dataset (data regarding 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil). I       started by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then used pandas, NumPy and             Matplotlib to answer the questions I am most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers. This analysis highlighted           several factors, which will help in predicting if a patient will show up for his/her scheduled appointment? I went through the data       analysis process: Asking questions, Wrangling the data, Performing EDA, Drawing conclusions and Communicating the results.
  
  
* **Test A Perceptual Phenomenon:**
  - In this project, I have created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the Stroop Effect. Analyzed the results using descriptive           statistics and a paired sample t-test (Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
  - Found that the Stroop Effect indeed interferes the reaction time associated with the task condition (Congruent, Incongruent)
  

* **Analyzing A/B Test results:**
  - In this project, I have performed an A/B test for an e-commerce website to help the company understand if they should implement the     new page or keep the old page (Python, Pandas, Numpy, Random, Matplotlib, StatsModels)
  - Found that the duration of the experiment is not enough to decide whether the new page is better or not
  
  
* **Red Wine Quality Exploration:**
  - In this project, I have applied exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a dataset contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables     on the chemical properties of the wine. Carried out Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis and calculated correlations to         identify relationships and patterns among variables. Technologies: R, ggplot2, dplyr, knitr
  - Found that very few variables have a strong correlation even though it is not very strong. Contrary to what I thought, Density has a     weak negative correlation with the quality and have a Pearson correlation r = - 0.17
